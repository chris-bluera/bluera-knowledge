name: CI

# CI runs on branch pushes and PRs, but NOT on tags.
#
# Why no tag trigger?
# - Auto Release workflow (auto-release.yml) waits for CI to pass on main
#   before creating a tag (uses wait-on-check-action with lint-and-typecheck,
#   test, build checks)
# - The tag contains the exact same code that just passed CI on main
# - Running CI again on the tag is redundant and wastes ~3 minutes per release
# - Release workflow (release.yml) trusts this guarantee and publishes immediately
#
# Quality guarantee chain:
#   push to main → CI passes → Auto Release creates tag → Release publishes
#
on:
  push:
    branches: ['**']
    # Note: tags intentionally excluded - see comment above
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# Prevent duplicate runs: cancel in-progress runs for same branch
# When a PR is open, only run the pull_request event (skip the push)
