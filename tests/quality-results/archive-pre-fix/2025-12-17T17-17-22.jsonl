The key documentation section (lines 2076-2145) which explicitly defines both methods and contrasts them ('If you don't want Zod to throw errors when validation fails, use .safeParse') is not well-represented in the snippets. The ERROR_HANDLING.md is included which adds some context. Missing: the explicit comparison explaining parse throws errors while safeParse returns a discriminated union. The search found 5 README.md results but none highlighted the canonical '.parse' vs '.safeParse' section.","snippetQuality":"Snippets are truncated and don't capture the full context needed to understand the comparison. Result 1 shows 'ello world' (truncated 'Hello world') followed by safeParse signature - the beginning is cut off. Result 2 shows an error handling example but not the method signature or explanation. The most valuable snippet would show: (1) .parse signature and behavior, (2) .safeParse signature and behavior, (3) the contrast between throwing vs returning. None of the snippets achieve this. The 'contentPreview' field is too short to be useful for understanding method differences."},"suggestions":["Implement semantic chunking that keeps related API method documentation together - the '.parse' and '.safeParse' sections (lines 2076-2145) should be treated as a single chunk since they're explicitly designed to be compared","Improve snippet extraction to start at natural boundaries (section headers like '### .parse') rather than mid-sentence ('ello world')","Add query intent detection - 'vs' or 'compare' queries should boost results that contain both terms in close proximity and penalize results with only one term","Extend contentPreview length for documentation queries - 150 characters is insufficient for API comparison questions","Deprioritize CHANGELOG.md and blog posts for API documentation queries - these should rank below README.md and dedicated docs files","Consider indexing markdown headers as semantic anchors so '### .parse' and '### .safeParse' sections are retrievable as distinct units","Implement result deduplication/consolidation - 5 README.md results at different offsets could be consolidated into one comprehensive result showing the full relevant section"],"resultAssessments":[{"rank":1,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/README.md","relevant":true,"note":"Shows .safeParse signature and basic usage - directly relevant but snippet is truncated at start ('ello world')"},{"rank":2,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/README.md","relevant":true,"note":"Shows error handling with safeParse - relevant example but doesn't explain parse vs safeParse difference"},{"rank":3,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/ERROR_HANDLING.md","relevant":true,"note":"Tangentially relevant - provides error handling context which relates to why you'd choose safeParse"},{"rank":4,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/CHANGELOG.md","relevant":false,"note":"Not relevant - changelog entries about refactoring, doesn't explain parse vs safeParse usage"},{"rank":5,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/blog/clerk-fellowship.md","relevant":false,"note":"Not relevant - blog post about codebase changes, not API documentation"},{"rank":6,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/src/types.ts","relevant":false,"note":"Marginally relevant - shows internal _parse implementation but not useful for understanding API differences"},{"rank":7,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/README.md","relevant":false,"note":"Not relevant - about .catch() feature, incidentally mentions parsing but doesn't compare parse vs safeParse"},{"rank":8,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/README.md","relevant":false,"note":"Not relevant - about .passthrough() for object schemas, not parse vs safeParse comparison"},{"rank":9,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/README.md","relevant":false,"note":"Not relevant - about transform feature, doesn't address parse vs safeParse question"},{"rank":10,"source":"/Users/chris/repos/bluera-studio-work/bluera-knowledge/tests/fixtures/corpus/oss-repos/zod/src/types.ts","relevant":false,"note":"Not relevant - internal implementation showing safeParse call, not documentation"}]},"searchTimeMs":359,"evaluationTimeMs":56966}],"topSuggestions":["verify the corpus actually contains zod-related content - if not, this is expected behavior","if zod content exists, check if 'zod' as a term is being properly indexed (case sensitivity, tokeniz","consider adding synonym/related term expansion: 'zod' could relate to 'schema validation', 'typescri","check if the search handles library/package names correctly - 'zod' is a short, specific term that m","add zod documentation or examples to the corpus if this is a technical knowledge base that should co"],"totalTimeMs":355579}}
